// this is the interface for the event handler. Events are temporally
// delayed events. Events and actions (see action.h) may seem similar. They
// do, however, share some distinct differences. Whereas actions can only
// be attached to characters, and only one action can be attached to a 
// character at a time, events can be attached to anything, and anything can
// have any number of events attached to it at a time. And, indeed, they do
// not even need to be attached to anything! Some examples of what might
// constitute an event are things like a quest that is scheduled to start in
// 5 minutes, a disease that will kill someone in 5 minutes unless they find
// a cure for it, or perhaps a scheduled game reboot.

//
// Put an event into the event handler. When the delay reaches 0, 
// on_complete is called.
//
// on_complete must be a function that takes the owner as its first
// argument, the data as its second, and the argument as its third.
//
// check_involvement must be a function that takes the thing to check
// the involvement of as the first argument, and the data to check in
// as its second argument. It must return TRUE if the data contains
// a pointer to the thing, and FALSE otherwise. See admin.c (cmd_devent)
// for an example of how this works.
