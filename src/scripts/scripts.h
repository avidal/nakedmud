// NakedMud makes extensive use of scripting. It uses scripting to generate
// objects, mobiles, and rooms when they are loaded into the game. There are
// also scripting hooks for these things (commonly referred to as triggers), 
// which allow them to be a bit more dynamic and flavorful in the game. For
// instance, greetings when someone enters a room, repsonses to questions, 
// actions when items are received.. you know... that sort of stuff. 
//
//*****************************************************************************

//
// these includes are needed by anything that deals with scripts. Might as
// well put them in here so people do not always have to include them manually
// One problem we run into is that Python.h needs to define a certain value for
// _POSIX_C_SOURCE. However, it never checks if _POSIX_C_SOURCE has already
// been defined. So, we have to do it here.

// it's unique string identifier for lookup in the world databse. And, finally,
// its code is the python script that executes when this trigger is run.
