//
// One of the questions that came up when designing NakedMud is, how do we
// efficiently implement bitvectors while maintaining the modularity of the mud?
// For those unfamiliar with the purposes of a bitvector, let me elaborate:
// there are many instances in which we may want to know about the presence or
// absence of a property (e.g. is the room dark? is the character blind?). We
// could easily have a variable for each of these properties in the relevant
// datastructures, but this is often quite wasteful on memory. What would be
// really nice is if we could compress the space that it took to store one
// bit of information (in C, the smallest basic datatype is 8 bits ... i.e. we
// are wasting 7 bits to store a piece of information that be represented as
// on/off). In a nutshell, this is the purpose of a bitvector (there are more
// reasons why bitvectors are attractive, but this is perhaps the most important
// one in the context of muds).
//
// For anyone who has ever worked on a DIKU-derivative, they know that
// bits in a bitvector are typically declared on after another like this:
//    #define BIT_ONE    (1 << 0)
//    #define BIT_TWO    (1 << 1)
//    #define BIT_THREE  (1 << 2)
//    ...
//
// Of course, this is hugely unattractive for us: If we had a module that wanted
// to add a new bit, we surely would not want to add it to some global header
// file; we would want to keep the definition within the module headers. And,
// most certainly we cannot do this because we have to assocciate a position
// with each bit name, and every other module has to know that position so that
// noone else adds a new bit with the same position. This module is an attempt
// to address this problem, allowing modules to use bits, keep their 
// declarations in some place local to the module, and make sure there are no
// conflicting definitions. This also ensures that bits are persistent for all
// rooms, objects, and characters (ie. they save if we crash, or the player
// logs off, or whatnot).
