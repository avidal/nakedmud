GEOFF'S TO DO LIST
+-- KNOWN BUGS
  * moving via tracking will not trigger enter/exit scripts


+-- NOT COMPLETE
  * spellchecking in the text editor
  * Redo OLC so that if a module uses OLC, it can add the relevant functions
    from its own module.
  * Devise something to replace bitvectors that is a bit more amenable to
    keeping things modular.
  * condense normal and special exits in rooms
  * soft-code chat channels
  * random dungeon generator
  * mounts and vehicles
  * being able to stream music would be cool...
  * clean up and document resedit in the olc module
  * shops (for mobiles and players)
  * customized prompts
  * DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT!! Most of the major headers need full
    documentation still.
  * character positions and changing of positions is a bit of a hack.
    it could really do with some cleaning up. Move their defines to mud.h
    too, so that modules wanting to add new commands don't need to include
    character.h
  * Mysty's Dialog
    * Betta
    * Oren


+-- NEEDS EXTRA WORK
  * write helpfiles, create a better helpfile system, and do hedit
  * tracking and path following -> daily routines, and patrols
  * displaying mob/obj/room/exit vnums for immortals -> do we want to also
    display this stuff for furniture?
  * debug dialogs. Also have a new addition, STORY for temporally extended
    responses


+-- NEEDS DEBUGGING
  * text editor
