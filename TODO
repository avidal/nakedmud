GEOFF'S TO DO LIST
+-- CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
  * vnums: do we even need them? Objects and NPCs: inheritance, like OOP?

+-- KNOWN BUGS
  * moving via tracking will not trigger enter/exit scripts

+-- NOT COMPLETE
 +-- HIGH PRIORITY
   * bedit -> bitvector edit
   * create an insert function for the script editor that kills carraige returns
   * redo sets to be in a tree form rather than a table form
   * redo hashtables so that they will auto-enlarge themselves
   * Rewrite the character creation input handling stuff; it's kludgy
   * character positions and changing of positions is a bit of a hack.
     it could really do with some cleaning up. Move their defines to mud.h
     too, so that modules wanting to add new commands don't need to include
     character.h
   * condense normal and special exits in rooms
   * clean up everything related to sockets... the entire socket.c file is a
     mess. Emphasis on the MCCP stuff (put it in its own file), and the text
     editing stuff (it's a hack...).

 +-- LOW PRIORITY
   * Mysty's Dialog
     * Betta
     * Oren
   * make tracking use BFS instead of DFS
   * Bulletin board/forum system
   * soft-code chat channels
   * spellchecking in the text editor
   * mounts and vehicles
   * shops (for mobiles and players)
   * customized prompts
   * DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT!! Most of the major headers need full
     documentation still.
   * random dungeon generator
   * being able to stream music would be cool...

+-- NEEDS EXTRA WORK
  * write helpfiles, create a better helpfile system, and do hedit
  * tracking and path following -> daily routines, and patrols
  * displaying mob/obj/room/exit vnums for immortals -> do we want to also
    display this stuff for furniture?
  * debug dialogs. Also have a new addition, STORY for temporally extended
    responses

+-- NEEDS DEBUGGING
