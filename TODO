GEOFF'S TO DO LIST
+-- KNOWN BUGS


+-- NOT COMPLETE
  * remove the EXIT_DATA parameter from the script functions
  * write helpfiles, create a better helpfile system, and do hedit
  * condense normal and special exits in rooms
  * soft-code chat channels
  * random dungeon generator
  * spellchecking in the text editor
  * mounts and vehicles
  * being able to stream music would be cool...
  * clean up and document resedit in the olc module
  * tracking and path following
  * shops (for mobiles and players)
  * customized prompts
  * DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT!! Most of the major headers need full
    documentation still.
  * character positions and changing of positions is a bit of a hack.
    it could really do with some cleaning up. Move their defines to mud.h
    too, so that modules wanting to add new commands don't need to include
    character.h
  * Mysty's Dialog
    * Betta
    * Oren


+-- NEEDS EXTRA WORK

    responses


+-- NEEDS DEBUGGING
  * containers

  * Make sure extract obj/char is catching everything, and is running well
  * Delayed action and event handlers
  * Generic find algorithm
  * Bodytypes, especially when setting a character's bodytype anew
  * text editor
