--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v2.6 TO v2.7

The bulk of the patch from version 2.6 to 2.7 is pretty easy. First, back up 
your lib and src folders. Next, simply enter your MUD's root directory (the one
that has the src/ and lib/ and doc/ directories) and then run the patch file:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv2.6-to-nakedmudv2.7.patch

You will also have to start and shut down your MUD once for the patch to take
full effect. In v2.7, we introduced new conventions for storing world data. When
you start up the MUD for the first time, it will automatically convert all of
your old world data to meet the new standards. This is especially important if
you will be patching up to an even newer version (if one is available), because
it is not gauranteed that the conversion utilities will be present in later
versions of NakedMud.
