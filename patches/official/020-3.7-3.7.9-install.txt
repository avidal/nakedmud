--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v3.7 TO v3.7.9

Before you do anything else, BACK UP YOUR MUD, AND ITS CONTENTS!! From the src 
directory, type make backup. This will back up your src/ and lib/ directories 
to a .tgz archive in the backup/ directory.

The lib/world/ directory has been restructured in preparation for world
persistence. Create a new directory, lib/world/zones/ and for each zone
directory you have created (by default, examples/ and limbo/), move it from
lib/world/ to lib/world/zones/

Once you have done this, You can apply the patch. Enter your mud's root 
directory (the one containing your src, lib, doc, etc... folders) and type:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv3.7-to-nakedmudv3.7.9.patch
