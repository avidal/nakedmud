--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v2.1.1 TO v2.2

The bulk of the patch from version 2.1.1 to 2.2 is pretty easy. Simply enter
your MUDs root directory (the one that has the src/ and lib/ and doc/ 
directories) and then run the patch file:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv2.1.1-to-nakedmudv2.2.patch

You will also have to add a few directories for account info. Try this:
  cp -R lib/players/pfiles lib/accounts         // copy the directory structure
  rm lib/accounts/*/*                           // clean out all the files

Sadly, there is no automatic way to assign old characters to accounts, so you'll
have to do the bulk of this by hand. This can be done either by editing the
account files or through the online account editor, accedit. For the first 
character, you'll have to go through the account files so you can log on an 
admin char and use accedit. The process is pretty simple. Open up the account
file you'd like to edit, and add the following bits to it:

characters:=
  name: <char name here>
  -
  name: <another name here>
  -
  name: <and so forth>
  -
-

Once this is done, the account will be able to log on the chars you add to it.
Do this for your admin, and then log on your admin. You can now edit accounts
online with the accedit command:
  accedit <account name>

It's a standard OLC interface, and pretty straightforward to use.

You may also want to add in the new helpfiles, which can be downloaded from the
NakedMud website; they are bundled in download for the latest version (v2.2).
