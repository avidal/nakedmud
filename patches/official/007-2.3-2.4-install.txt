--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v2.3 TO v2.4

The bulk of the patch from version 2.3 to 2.4 is pretty easy. Simply enter
your MUD's root directory (the one that has the src/ and lib/ and doc/
directories) and then run the patch file:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv2.3-to-nakedmudv2.4.patch

in addition to this, you will also have to create a new backup directory:
  mkdir backup

complete!
