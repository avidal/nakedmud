--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v2.7 TO v3.0

Before you do anything else, BACK UP YOUR MUD, AND ITS CONTENTS!! From the src 
directory, type make backup. This will back up your src/ and lib/ directories 
to a .tgz archive in the backup/ directory.

Once you have done this, You can take one of two approaches: run the patch file
to update to v3.0, or download a copy of v3.0 and install any modules you have
already written. If you have not made many changes to the NakedMud core, it is
suggested you take the second approach. It will save you much trouble of having
to hand-patch .rej files. The patch from v2.7 to v3.0 is 26k lines. That is the
same size as all other patches that have been released, combined together! If
you take the first approach, you can run the patch file like this:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv2.7-to-nakedmudv3.0.patch

Once you have patched up the source code, you will have to make some alterations
to your world directory. Specifically, you'll have to completely replace it!
The way things are stored was completely changed. And unfortunately, the new
way is not compatible with the old way. replace your lib/world directory with
the world directory supplied in this patch. A utility for converting old-format
zones to new-format zones will be available soon. Account and player files do
not have to be altered. I apologize profusely for any inconveniences this may
cause.
