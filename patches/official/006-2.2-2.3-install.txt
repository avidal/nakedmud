--- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS FROM v2.2 TO v2.3

The bulk of the patch from version 2.2 to 2.3 is pretty easy. Simply enter
your MUD's root directory (the one that has the src/ and lib/ and doc/
directories) and then run the patch file:
  patch -p0 < nakedmudv2.2-to-nakedmudv2.3.patch

One of the major changes in this patch was the elimination of levels and the
addition of "user groups" to control access to different commands. You will have
to edit the groups of all your admin-type characters to reflect their previous
level status. This can be done through editing a player file and setting the
appropriate groups:

user_groups: <comma-separated list of groups here>

Each command belongs to one and only one group. Any user can belong to multiple
groups. Your head admin will probably want to belong to all of the groups (e.g.
admin, scripter, builder, playtester, player) for access to all of the game's
commands (hint: that is what the user_groups tag in your head admin's pfile
should look like - hopefully you can figure out the rest from there). 

One you have one admin character reassigned groups, you can reassign the rest
online through the set <person> groups <groups go here> command.

You may also want to add in the new helpfiles, which can be downloaded from the
NakedMud website; they are bundled in the download for the latest 
version (v2.3).
