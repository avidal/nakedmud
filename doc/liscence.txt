NakedMud version 0.1 is public domain; it is free to use for any purpose you
would like to use it for, without restriction from the creator, Geoff Hollis. 
By using it, or any pieces of the code, you agree to absolve responsibility 
from the creator, Geoff Hollis, and take full responsibility for anything 
NakedMud or pieces of the NakedMud code may cause to happen.

Since NakedMud was based on SocketMud by Brian Graversen, I ask that you follow
Brian's requests as per giving credit to Erwin Andreasen for the snippets he
supplied in SocketMud's code (see README). I also request you credit Brian for
the work he put into SocketMud, and myself for the work I put into NakedMud.
