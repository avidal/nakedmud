Startup should be pretty easy. To compile, simply go into the src directory and
type "make". Everything should compile automagically. From here, to start, you
simply type ./NakedMud <port> & If you do not supply a port, the MUD will
start up on port 4000 by default.

If you're having troubles compiling when it gets to the scripts, you will want
to read src/modules/scripts/Makefile

If you've got other problems and cannot figure out what to do, you can try
giving me a description of your problem, and I'll see if I can help you out. No
promises, though.
