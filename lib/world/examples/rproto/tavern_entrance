Some chat amongst  themselves, some play cards and dice games, and others are simply sitting  idle, watching the other people in the tavern.  The bar is to the south. People are lined up along it, but you can spot a few open seats.  There are  also a couple empty tables scattered throughout the tavern.  To the north, you  see a small entertainment stage which seems to be empty at the moment.  To the  west, you see a fireplace with a bunch of people scattered about it. "
