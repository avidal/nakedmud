       This looks like quite the popular place; many tables are scattered 
    around the tavern.  Groups of people huddle around them.  Some chat 
    amongst themselves, some play cards and dice games, and others are simply 
    sitting idle, watching the other people in the tavern.  The bar is to the 
    south.  People are lined up along it, but you can spot a few open seats.
    There are also a couple empty tables scattered throughout the tavern.  To 
    the north, you see a small entertainment stage which seems to be empty at 
    the moment.  To the west, you see a fireplace with a bunch of people 
    scattered about it.

       The bar is fairly busy, but you notice a couple of stools left unoccupied.
    Servers come past now and then, picking up trays of drinks for their 
    customers.  Most of the customers at the bar seem to be older on in the years, 
    paying more attention to their drinks than to the crowd.  The bartenders all 
    seems to be busy with preparing drinks for the customers. An entertainment
    stage is on the far northern end of the tavern, but it appears to be empty
    at the moment. A large fireplace is burning merrily to the northwest. There
    seems to be a few people huddled around it.
