    message : crab merchants from Freeport recently passed through, and we stocked up. I would suggest our current special of steamed crab. It comes with a side of potatos - mashed or baked - greens, and a bun. We also have a wonderful pudding ale on tap, if you are interested. Our regular menu consists of steak, veal, breaded porkchops, shepard's pie, and salmon. If you would like to order anything, simply say so.

    message : Bones is one of Symon's favorite games. I've seen him play - he's quite good at it. If you have some spare money to burn, ask him about bones. I'm sure he'd be willing to play you a game or two. Just don't blame me when you lose your money to him!
