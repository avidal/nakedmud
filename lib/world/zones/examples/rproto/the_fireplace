The warmth of the fire is quite  soothing, and you can't help but feel like sitting down and relaxing by its  warmth.  To the northeast, you see a small entertainment stage which is empty  at the moment.  To the east, there are a few more open tables to sit at, and  to the southeast is the bar which seems to be filling up rather quickly.  To  the south is a rather dark corner of the tavern that does not look too  inviting. "
