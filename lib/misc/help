    There are 9 fields assocciated with social editing; two are for messages when
    the social has no target. Two are for messages when the target is the character
    performing the social. Three are for situations when a target other than the
    character is provided for the social. The remaining two are the minimum and
    maximum positions the socials can be used from. If a social is not to have a
    target, the "target" fields can be left blank. Likewise, if the social is never
    to have the character as a target, the assocciated fields can be left blank.
    When trying to reference character information, the following symbols can be
    used:
    
      $n character name
      $N target name
      $e character he/she
      $E target he/she
      $m character him/her
      $M target him/her
      $s character his/hers
      $S target his/hers
    
    To see examples of how to write socials, check some of the pre-existing ones.
    To generate a list of all socials, type "socials".
    
    If you would like more than one command to trigger the same social, you can
    link a new command to a pre-existing social. Likewise, if you would like to
    disable a social command, that is possible too.

  info     :~
    The Mud Client Compression Protocol has the purpose of reducing the bandwidth 
    usage of the mudserver, by using an MCCP-complient mudclient, the data send to 
    you will be compressed by 80-85%, and thus not only reducing the amount of data
    processed by the server, but also greatly reduce the amount of data you need to
    download (i.e. less lag for you).
    
    This MUD supports both version 1 and 2 of the compression protocol, and any 
    client supporting either of those version can be used to enable compression. 
    Most clients enables compression automaticly, but some require that you type 
    'compress'. The same command can also be used to disable compression.

    Look allows you to glean extra information about your environment, as well as
    people and items in it. Look can be used to peer into containers, glance at
    your room, examine the finer details of an item, among other things.
    
    Usage: 
      > look [at the <target>] [in the <container>] [on the <thing or person>]
    
    Examples: 
      > look
      > look bob
      > look at bob
      > look at the bob
      > look at the mole on bob
      > look in sheath
      > look hilt on sword in sheath
      > look at the hilt on the sword in the sheath
    
    Looking at an object that is a container will also peer inside and list its
    contents (provided the container is opened).

    On-Line Creation (OLC) is a set of utilities designed to allow builders to
    design their zones while on the MUD. OLC includes utilities for editing zones,
    rooms, objects, mobiles, scripts, and dialogues. The following commands are
    available to the online builder:
    
          edits                command                 listing command
          rooms                redit                   rlist <zone vnum>
          objects              oedit                   olist <zone vnum>
          mobiles              medit                   mlist <zone vnum>
          scripts              scedit                  sclist <zone vnum>
          dialogs              dedit                   dlist <zone vnum>
          socials              socedit                 socials
          zones                zedit                   zlist
    
    To create a new zone, a special command must be used. It's format is:
      zedit new [zone num] [min vnum] [max vnum]
    
    All other OLC commands can set up new things (rooms, objects, mobiles, etc..)
    simply by using the corresponding edit command on a vnum that has not been used.

    As a builder, you may at times create rooms, objects, mobiles, scripts,
    etc... that you do not want to be part of your zone. You can delete these
    things with the line of delete functions available. There should be one for
    each major type of editable zone content. When deleting rooms, anyone in the
    room will be removed from the game, and sockets will be disconnected.
    
    delete commands are: odelete, mdelete, rdelete, scdelete, and ddelete. Syntax
    is as follows: <delete command> <vnum to delete>

  info     :~
    NakedMud supports ANSI colors, and you can access them by using the '{{'
    character, followed by the colorkey from the table below.
    
    Yellow    {yy {YY{n
    Blue      {bb {BB{n
    Green     {gg {GG{n
    Red       {rr {RR{n
    Cyan      {cc {CC{n
    Purple    {pp {PP{n
    Dark      {dd {DD{n
    White     {ww {WW{n
    
    The 'n' key is the default NakedMud color, and the mudcolor will always
    revert to this color at the end of a string.
