Look allows you to glean extra information about your environment, as well as
people and items in it. Look can be used to peer into containers, glance at
your room, examine the finer details of an item, among other things.

Usage: 
  > look [at the <target>] [in the <container>] [on the <thing or person>]

Examples: 
  > look
  > look bob
  > look at bob
  > look at the bob
  > look at the mole on bob
  > look in sheath
  > look hilt on sword in sheath
  > look at the hilt on the sword in the sheath

Looking at an object that is a container will also peer inside and list its
contents (provided the container is opened).
