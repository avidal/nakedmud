On-Line Creation (OLC) is a set of utilities designed to allow builders to
design their zones while on the MUD. OLC includes utilities for editing zones,
rooms, objects, mobiles, scripts, and dialogues. The following commands are
available to the online builder

      edits                command                 listing command
      rooms		   redit		   rlist <zone vnum>
      objects		   oedit		   olist <zone vnum>
      mobiles		   medit		   mlist <zone vnum>
      scripts		   scedit		   sclist <zone vnum>
      dialogs		   dedit		   dlist <zone vnum>
      zones		   zedit		   zlist

To create a new zone, a special command must be used. It's format is:
  zedit new [zone num] [min vnum] [max vnum]

All other OLC commands can set up new things (rooms, objects, mobiles, etc..)
simply by using the corresponding edit command on a vnum that has not been used.
