The Mud Client Compression Protocol has the purpose of reducing the
bandwidth usage of the mudserver, by using an MCCP-complient mudclient,
the data send to you will be compressed by 80-85%, and thus not only
reducing the amount of data processed by the server, but also greatly
reduce the amount of data you need to download (i.e. less lag for you).

This MUD supports both version 1 and 2 of the compression protocol,
and any client supporting either of those version can be used to
enable compression. Most clients enables compression automaticly,
but some require that you type 'compress'. The same command can also
be used to disable compression.
