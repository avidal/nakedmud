Jobo aka Brian Graversen is the author of SocketMud(tm), which is a
bareboned mud codebase. The codebase was made mainly for fun and to
learn from the experience itself.

Feel free to use the codebase for whatever purposes you have in mind,
and should you ever make a real mud from it, send me a mail and tell
me about it at jobo@daimi.au.dk
